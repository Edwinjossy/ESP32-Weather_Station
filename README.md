# ESP32 WeatherStation 
This project aims to build a weather station board for recording and uploading common weather data. The measured data can be uploaded to WUnderground or stored and displayed on a dashboard using a local Thingsboard server.

The custom PCB board is designed to work as a shield for the [ESP32 Dev board](https://www.az-delivery.de/it/products/esp32-developmentboard).

As an exercise, no external libraries are used to communicate with the sensors. All drivers are written from scratch. The framework used is ESP-IDF.
